Kan Zhou: Finished the constructor of FakebookHTMLParser, which extends the HTMLParser class. I override three methods in FakebookHTMLParser class.

Override three methods: handle_starttag, handle_endtag, handle_data

I am currently using a match loop to match tags in my code, but I am facing some challenges in regards to posting and getting protocols. I have tested my code using various other codes.
